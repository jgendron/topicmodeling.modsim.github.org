Materials in medical simulations typically consist of polymers such as PVC, silicone, and some slightly more esoteric materials. While adequate for procedural training, they are typically lacking in the realism necessary to fully engage the learner. To improve the behaviors of simulated tissues, a better understanding of the mechanics of human tissue is required. To address this problem, the military is working closely with academia to broadly characterize fresh human cadaver tissues that are of interest to military medical learning. This paper compares the measured mechanical properties of simulated tissues from medical trainers against human tissues that would be subject to a chest tube insertion (skin, pleura). The research will also begin the development of models to translate human tissue data into performance requirements for future simulated tissues.
