The purpose of this paper is to describe how real aircraft test sets may be a viable option for use on simulated maintenance training devices. The decision to utilize two real aircraft test sets on the UH-60M Black Hawk Electrical Trainer (BHET-M) will be discussed in detail. The first section will provide an introduction of the BHET- M trainer and the requirements of the training device. The next section will describe how and why the decision was made to utilize the real aircraft test set versus a simulated test set. This process includes determining the requirements of the test set to support the Maintenance Operational Checks (MOCS) and Fault Isolation Procedures (FIPS) that are to be trained on the device. For example:
(1) How much of the test set functionality is required to meet the MOC/FIP requirement?
(2) Does the overall system design support the test set solution?
(3) What is the test set user interface?
(4) Is trainer unique cabling acceptable?
(5) What is the cost to build a mock-up versus the cost of the real unit?
The next section describes how two real aircraft test sets were designed into the BHET-M simulated aircraft environment. This design can be viewed as reverse stimulation in a sense, where the real test sets are injecting real aircraft signals (electrical signals, air pressure) into the simulated aircraft environment. The following section explains how the test sets were implemented into the system providing details on the hardware data acquisition (DAQ) system and how the software interpreted the real test set data. The next section describes the integration of the test sets and problems encountered during the integration phase. The last section describes the test phases, how the test sets performed in a full-up environment, and how the customer reacted to the use of the test sets. Finally the conclusion discusses the overall successes, failures and whether the same decision to utilize the aircraft test sets would be made in hindsight.
