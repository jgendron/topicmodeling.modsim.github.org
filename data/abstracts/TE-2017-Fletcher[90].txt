     A 2015 analysis of published AR/AV research identified 22 reports that examined and reported empirical data concerning the effectiveness of Augmented Reality (AR) & Augmented Virtuality (AV) for education, training, and performance aiding. Current assessments focused on testing the technology itself (e.g., safety; specifications; capabilities) are numerous, impressive, and essential. However, assessments with objective, empirical data about AR/AV effectiveness for training and performance are comparatively rare. Most reports on effectiveness comparing AR/AV to alternatives suggest that AR/AV reduces time (effect size = 0.52 and errors (effect size = 0.81 in performing skilled tasks, increases the amount learned (effect size = 0.44), produces learning that is more resistant to decay (effect size = 0.71), is preferred to other approaches (effect size = 0.81), and increases immersion (ÒflowÓ) during learning (effect size = 0.67). Other findings of interest were reported from individual studies. However simulator sickness remains a problem. Recommendations from the analysis included: Increased emphasis on empirical assessment of AR/AV effectiveness compared to other systems; research on the development of systems using machine intelligence combined with AR/AV; research on adapting AR/AV to individual differences; exploiting the potential of AR/AV to enhance success in performing military operations in combat service support (e.g., maintenance and repair) activities; cost- effectiveness assessment AR/AV in both training and performance aiding; and continuing review of costs and advances in commercial AR/AV technology.
