Unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) have become a key technology for payload delivery, remote sensing, and surveillance. Most development involves converting existing manned vehicles to unmanned, but several vessels are specifically designed for unmanned operation. One such vessel is the Wave Adaptive Modular Vessel (WAM-V), manufactured by Marine Advanced Research. To maintain flexibility, the WAM-V leaves the design of the propulsion system to the user. This paper describes the use of simulation to optimize the mechanical design of a WAM-V propulsion system. Given the wide availability of marine propulsion approaches and design options, it is impractical to experiment with physical prototypes. Simulation-based optimization is the most viable approach for optimizing system performance. The paper describes the initial analysis and use of simulation to finalize the propulsion system design. This is an interesting engineering case study because it combines multiple levels and types of simulation for system optimization based on multiple constraints.
