Massive open online courses (MOOCs) could solve old problems in new ways. More than ever, people need access to knowledge. Since the earliest of days, this has been a never-ending quest. This paper looks at the knowledge process from the domain of education in order to stimulate innovation and advancement in another source of knowledge â modeling and simulation. This paper explores knowledge, starting with the innovations that propelled MOOCs to their current position in the marketplace. It then offers a framework based on current studies and draws parallels to modeling and simulation, probing the questions as to how modeling and simulation can learn from MOOCs so decision makers have greater access to knowledge more directly and easily through modeling and simulation tools as well as the discipline formed by that community. Today's modeling and simulation leaders need awareness of the MOOC business model and the potentially high returns on investment when integrating models and tools to solve new problems.
