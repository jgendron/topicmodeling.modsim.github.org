    In 2013, more than 3,000 people were killed (and more than 420,000 injured) in motor vehicle crashes involving distracted drivers. There are three primary types of driving distraction: visual (e.g., eyes off the road), mechanical (e.g., hands off the wheel), and cognitive (e.g., mind off the task). Regarding the latter, distractions internal to the driver are defined as âthe decoupling of attention from the task at hand, coincident with a shift in focus to internal thought processesâ. Recent studies estimate that internally-distracted driving is the least understood and most deadly form of distracted driving, contributing to more than 60% of fatal distracted driving accidents.
In this paper, we describe the design, development, and implementation of a game-based simulation environment within which to induce and measure a state of internal distraction while driving. This paper will focus on technical development details for the driving simulation environment, including a) scene graph and visualization model design, b) simulation models for vehicle dynamics, motion and sound cues, c) an artificially intelligent traffic model, and d) an accompanying scoring model to provide drivers with concrete performance feedback.
The environment has been deployed on a small cohort of graduate students enrolled in a Traffic Safety engineering course. Participants performed the experiment, which included self-report to assess elements of driving history and style, and trait levels of task-unrelated thought. Participants endeavored three drives aboard the high-fidelity simulator (acclimation, baseline, and distracted); a selection of the observed results (and accompanying analysis) will likewise be reported here.
