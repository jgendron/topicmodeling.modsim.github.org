Animal disease outbreaks are a global concern. These outbreaks can cause food scarcity and economic losses, impact animal health, and, if zoonotic, affect human health. For an outbreak of a disease not currently found within a country, these consequences can be greater. Disease modeling is one tool that can be used to better understand disease spread and evaluate different control strategies. USDAÐAPHISÐVSÐCEAH addresses questions related to minimizing the consequences of outbreaks while protecting our nationÕs livestock, food supply, and the environment. Using modeling tools, analysts evaluate alternative control strategies, provide recommendations on planning and effective use of resources, develop surveillance strategies, and estimate the economic impacts of disease control options. In this paper, we used the Animal Disease Spread Model (ADSM) to simulate an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease when introduced from multiple locations on the same day in a seven-state area of the United States. ADSM is a stochastic, spatially explicit compartmental model that simulates herd-to-herd spread of a highly contagious disease. The outbreak scattered in a variety of directions to other herds; however, only a few locations were infected consistently in a high percentage of iterations. Identifying locations at higher risk for disease introduction and/or spread can help decision- makers target risk-based surveillance and control strategies. Since ADSM is a new model available to the global modeling community, this paper also discusses the modeling process required by analysts to parameterize and use the model and highlights how this simulation method can provide useful information for decision-makers.
