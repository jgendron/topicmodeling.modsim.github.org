Safe civilian ports are a critical aspect of our infrastructure and our economy. Asymmetric threats against them have grown in both diversity and intensity. Advances in autonomous systems are evolving to counter these threats - and doing so effectively within constraints of shrinking budgets and personnel. This paper describes the Riverscout project - a significant technological advance to improve port security through the use of low cost, commercially available unmanned surface vehicles (USV) for monitoring and reconnaissance. Key benefits described in the paper include optics, to allow remote patrolling operations; onboard sensors, to detect threats; and an M&S-based training suite, to enable training based on the actual platform. A reconnaissance mission typically starts in autonomous mode with the USV following pre-planned waypoints. When any target is detected, the operator switches to manual remote mode to further interrogate. RiverscoutÕs autonomous capability reduces personnel requirements and provides standoff for crew protection.
