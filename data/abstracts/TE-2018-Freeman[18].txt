For the last half century, there has been a dramatic increase in the use of problem solving applications in systems engineering. Problem solving can be leveraged to enhance conventional mechanisms for engineering design, bridging the gap between understanding system complexity and real-world operational work tasks to better enable system functional output. This paper discusses the technical and experimental design of a critical component in the F-1 rocket engine, the injector, responsible for combustion instability. A qualitative analysis of over 100 interviews accessed from NASA Oral History Project shows Apollo program engineers and scientists searching for the problem domain through controlled experimentation and empirical evidence of performance anomalies. Exploring the counterpart solution domain space, they were able to modify configuration of the design space. The case study provides a historical model of aggressive engineering and for learners to find the elusive problem domain that narrowly discerns system performance for what does not work from what works.
