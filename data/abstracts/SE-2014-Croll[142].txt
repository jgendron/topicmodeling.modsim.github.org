Even though the architecture of Inertial Navigation Systems (INS) remains relatively constant, a designer is faced with numerous choices when it comes to identifying the appropriate sensors, selecting among similar sensors and configuring the appropriate filtering. Software tools that can simulate an INS are frequently used so support a specific INS model but there are relatively few general purpose tools that support arbitrary INS topologies. In this paper we describe a framework that supports modeling and simulation of INS. The framework is not tied to a specific INS topology and allows modeling at an arbitrary level of detail. Some novel features of the framework include a data dictionary that contains the system interface specification and which allows automated checking of the interfaces between modules, a scenario generator that can automatically generate Monte Carlo simulations based on specific input parameters, and a data-aware post-processor that can compactly display simulation results. The paper describes the framework and provides examples of its usage.
