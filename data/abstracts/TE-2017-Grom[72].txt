The Joint Staff (JS) Joint Training Directorate (J7) Environment Architecture Division (EAD) is developing modular simulation services known as the Joint Training Tools (JTT) to reside within the Joint Training Synthetic Environment (JTSE). JTT will be a cloud-based, web-enabled, enterprise environment that will provide scalable, modular simulation services on-demand, and operationally relevant training. Campaign planning is one of those modular simulation services. This iterative planning process incorporates situational analysis with respect to the enemy intent, enemy capability, and impacts of humanitarian assistance efforts for developing courses of action (COA)s that mitigate undesirable outcomes. This planning requires the integration of several standalone database services containing force structures and equipment information, geospatial databases and layers, and logistical supply consumption and movement databases. The Training Environment Manager (TEM) tool will support database integration by consuming, combining, and displaying data of interest. The Joint Exercise Design Tool (JEDT) will enable campaign plans creation by allowing users to review, adjudicate, or export user plans. Other JTT services will interoperate with TEM and JEDT according to Order of Battle (OOB), geospatial, or logistical needs. Simulation supported event designers will need less preparation time for making training situations more credible in terms of quality and realism, allowing for rapid integration of pre-existing data, and enabling dynamic access and update of data within real-time events. This paper will discuss how force structure, geospatial, and logistical information can help to achieve a Modeling and Simulation as a Service (MSaaS) environment.
