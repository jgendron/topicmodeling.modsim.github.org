Faced with an ever-changing technical environment, the need to create effective and inspiring content, and in many cases, a shrinking budget, it is critical for eLearning managers to know how to build and maintain a technically savvy, creative, and cost-effective team. Producing and pricing engaging eLearning is a challenge that, in many instances, cannot be achieved using a one person/one authoring tool solutionâit requires a team. Determining the correct mix of people is key to successfully delivering profitable and effective training. In this paper, we will examine the actions required to meet these challenges, leveraging research data from leading industry sources. We will describe the characteristics and cost data associated with eLearning professionalsâ specifically, instructional systems designers, web programmers, and digital artists. We will examine the driving factors/differentiators for pricing training products. Finally, we will present an algorithmic solution for determining the correct mix of professionals required to design and develop eLearning content, given specifications such as interactivity level, complexity of subject, need for original visual media, amount of content, etc.
