Since 2006, Congress has stressed the importance of increasing Science Technology Engineering and Mathematic (STEM) majors to meet 21st Century workforce demands (Hanushek, Peterson,& Woessmann, 2012; Carnevale, Smith, & Melton, 2011). While previous studies have analyzed the relationship among factors that influence studentÕs choice of a STEM major (Wang, 2012; Lent et al, 2005), no studies have used a grounded theory approach to develop a theoretical model. One of the benefits of using grounded theory is that the model can explain not only ÒwhatÓ influence studentsÕ choices of a STEM major but also Òwhy.Ó The primary data source for this pilot study was an individual, 30-45 minute, semi-structured, face-to-face interview with six undergraduate college students majoring in STEM fields recruited from the same undergraduate STEM Education and Professional Studies course. The semi-structured interview asked questions about participantsÕ experiences choosing their majors. At the end of the interview, data were transcribed and e-mailed to students for member checking. Results indicate emergence of six domains to explain choice of major: interest in STEM, workforce demand, academic support, early environment, self-achievement, and social support. Trends for the choice of majors are presented along with the design of an initial model. Further development of this model will include a system dynamic simulation for educators and policy makers to estimate how specific strategies change the number of students majoring in STEM.
