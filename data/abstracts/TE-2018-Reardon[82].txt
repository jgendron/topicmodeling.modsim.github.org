From conception to implementation, the development of a well-designed training system requires effective communication and tactful compromise within a multidisciplinary team of instructional designers, user experience experts, software developers, stakeholders, and end users. The design process applies even to seemingly trivial design choices. In this paper, we describe the process implemented to design a mobile application to train financial literacy. Taking a user-centered design approach, the team worked with customers, subject matter experts, and end-users to gather contextual information and design requirements specific to the usersÕ needs. To strengthen the bond between the users and the tool, financial concepts were re-imagined in the voice of a relatable mentor, akin to a trustworthy and knowledgeable friend, named Green Pig. What started initially as a mechanism for mobile immersion quickly emerged as its own entity capable of taking on multiple guises. In this presentation, the journey of Green Pig is used as a metaphor for the evolution, de-evolution, and resolution of the mobile-app design process. The goal for this paper is to provide a description of the iterative development process to understand the barriers that challenged success, how they were overcome, and what it takes to be established in todayÕs overcrowded world of training systems and mobile applications.
