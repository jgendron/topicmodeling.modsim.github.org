Many defense organizations report pressure to replace or augment scarce, expensive, and schedule-constrained pro- fessionals who are needed to counsel personnel. One method that has demonstrable capability and has found utility is the use of conversational, computer-directed agents. These can respond within appropriate times to a predeter- mined list of germane questions. These agents can be either animated or live (via a large number of video clips). Early research and development has focused on laboriously generating question lists, paraphrases, recording scripts, utterances, transcriptions, video edits, validations, tests, and updates. The administrative burden of all of this has begun to overshadow the scientific and technical research effort. As this virtual human capability becomes more acceptable and widely implemented, the skills of Systems Engineering are seen as potential facilitators for optimiz- ing the production process. This paper addresses preliminary experience with enhancing an on-going project via Systems Engineering. These approaches should make the adoption of these agents more practical and economical. The authors discuss the use of the V-Model and other Systems Engineering tools in a way that should enable other researchers to understand what can be expected of such an approach to computer-moderated virtual humans and agents. These management tools and techniques provide a real opportunity in the DoD to manifest the early success- es demonstrated in research settings. Optimizing just the transcription phase would save significant amounts of im- plementation time.
