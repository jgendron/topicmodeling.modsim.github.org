The Homeland Security Portfolio Value Model was developed by Old Dominion Universityâs (ODU) Virginia Modeling, Analysis and Simulation Center (VMASC) under the direction and guidance of the Virginia Department of Emergency Management (VDEM) and the Office of Veterans Affairs and Homeland Security in 2012 and again in 2013. The model was developed to aid senior executive decision makers in funding allocations for the Virginia Homeland Security Grant Program (HSGP). This paper provides the background for the project, the decision making environment, and modeling objectives. Then the model development process is described in which researchers elicited from senior leadership the scoring criteria, weighting, and value functions to be used for project scoring. This is followed by a description of the database development and deployment used to capture data and administer the proposal scoring process. The paper then provides a summary of the scoring results as well as allocation decisions, conclusions, limitations and future work.
