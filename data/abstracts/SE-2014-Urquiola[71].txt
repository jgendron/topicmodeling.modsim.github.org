In the mid-2000Õs, Combat Profiling emerged as a critical skill required by Warfighters for proactively identifying human threats (Wang-Costello, Tarr, and Marriffino, 2013). As this training evolves from a live, classroom-based paradigm to distributed virtual training, accurately representing biometric cues becomes increasingly important. Simulating facial cues, such as sweating, challenges system developers due to available technological capabilities (e.g., texturing protocols in standard simulation platforms) and a lack of clear design criteria. The purpose of this research is to identify requirements and design recommendations for representing behavior cues in simulation-based training (SBT). This paper aims to provide developers with design guidelines for accurately depicting biometric cues in virtual environments. Specifically, the authors present three common biometric cues used in Combat Profiling (e.g., reddening of the face, pallor, and sweating), discuss the potential underlying causes of each cue, explain the importance of skin tone, and provide visual representations for each cue.
