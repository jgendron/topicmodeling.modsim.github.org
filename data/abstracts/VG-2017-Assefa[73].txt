The U.S. Department of AgricultureâAnimal and Plant Health Inspection ServiceâVeterinary ServicesâCenter for Epidemiology and Animal Health addresses questions related to minimizing the consequences of animal disease outbreaks while protecting the nationâs livestock, food, and the environment. That includes modeling the economic impact of potential disease outbreaks using the Paarlberg model. The Paarlberg model is a quarterly economic model that allows analysts to simulate the potential economic impact of different types of disease spread across a number of different industries and commodities. Analysts are able to apply âshocksâ reflecting how different industries and trade partners are affected by a specific disease spread scenario and estimate the market impacts. The model produces large data sets that need to be analyzed and summarized. To do so, we used a data visualization software called Tableau. Tableau allows us to handle, analyze, and visualize large amounts of data in an efficient manner. We create dashboards that allow analysts and decision-makers alike to understand trends and patterns from model runs.
