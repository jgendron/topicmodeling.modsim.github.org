Improved realism in modeling and simulation (M&S) efforts is increasingly viewed as a necessity or requirement across a wide spectrum of Department of Defense (DoD) projects. However, the definition of M&S realism differs considerably across the community of practice. The goal is to clarify the requirements for realism; to elucidate the meaning of realism as it pertains to different communities; and to frame key concepts in the representation of reality. In general, M&S efforts support several functional areas, including: training, mission rehearsal, test, evaluation, experimentation, acquisition, analysis, and planning. Consider training, analysis, and acquisition as examples. The goal for M&S training is to cost-effectively challenge the skills of the trainee at the tactical, operational, and strategic levels. Skills should be challenged without risking injury to people, or damaging equipment. Training should encompass the full range of peacetime and wartime activities the trainee would engage in. M&S must provide realistic portrayals of the world to support that goal. Likewise, M&S analysis aims to provide a powerful set of tools to systematically evaluate and optimize alternative force structures against a range of foes, who may utilize potentially different tactics. The goal for M&S acquisition is to safely, cost-effectively and iteratively design virtual prototypes to assess the viability of future systems prior to production. Increased realism supports and improves the functional areas listed above. In order to provide identification with, and understanding of realism, perspectives from each functional area will be discussed in addition to the role of modeling paradigms and implementation concepts.
