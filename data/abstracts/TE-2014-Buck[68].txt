Mr. Wayne Buck NATO ACT Norfolk, Virginia buck@act.nato.int
Nearly ten years ago, the training and modeling and simulations (M&S) communities teamed up to tackle a burgeoning issue Ð the use of commercial technologies and games in NATO. The challenge came from the cultural change inherent in the domain. Small businesses were the leaders in the game space, yet they were perceived as risks among acquisition authorities. The proponents pushed forward by forming a Modeling and Simulation Group workshop series called ÒExploiting Commercial Technologies and Games for Use in NATOÓ to bridge the cultural gaps. Over ten years, twelve workshops have convened. Successes have been achieved and predictions made five years ago have been attained. This report provides (a) findings such as trends and possible explanations for factors contributing to attainment of workshop predications; (b) trends within technology, industry, and government with respect to commercial technologies and games for education and training; and (c) recommendations for consideration in planning future MSG commercial technology and games workshops.
