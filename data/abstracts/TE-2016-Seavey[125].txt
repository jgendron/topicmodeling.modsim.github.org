 As part of the U.S. Joint StaffÕs Bold Quest coalition capability demonstration and assessment event, Nations, Services and Programs (N/S/P) pool resources in a recurring cycle of capability development, demonstration and analysis. Bold Quest provides a venue where N/S/P can demonstrate integrated Live, Virtual and Constructive (LVC) environments, improve interoperability, and build and maintain joint fires proficiency. Unfortunately, LVC environments are, in practice, almost never Òplug and play.Ó Due to the number of simulation standards, and the various ways that systems are allowed to ÒcomplyÓ with these standards, simply adhering to a standard is no guarantee of interoperability. Bold Quest 15.2 provided the first opportunity to extend this LVC environment to partner nation simulator sites in France and Canada. French Air Force Joint Terminal Attack Controllers at the Air-Ground Operations School in Nancy-Ochey Airbase in France conducted virtual close air support missions with a U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) virtual AC-130 trainer at Hurlburt Field, Florida. A Canadian infantry section at the Canadian Army Simulation Centre in Kingston, Ontario conducted virtual missions with U.S., Canadian and Danish units at Fort Bliss, Texas and U.S. squads at Camp Atterbury, Indiana. Despite a number of simulator interoperability issues, these events were generally a success. However, these fundamental interoperability issues are widely recognized, ongoing problems that stand as a significant barrier to improving multi-Service and multinational simulator interoperability. This paper discusses the interoperability challenges faced during Bold Quest 15.2, outlines some of the solutions developed, and offers recommendations for improving joint and coalition simulator interoperability.
