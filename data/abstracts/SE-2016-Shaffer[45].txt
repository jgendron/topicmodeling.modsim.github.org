Newport News Shipbuilding is the only shipyard that builds nuclear powered aircraft carriers and is one of only two companies that build nuclear powered submarines for the U.S. Navy. In addition to constructing these, one of the many services that Newport News Shipbuilding provides is the periodic overhaul of existing U.S. Navy aircraft carriers. These aircraft carriers have thousands of compartments that require various work activities at varying extents. This paper presents a simulation project effort aimed at simulating the work activities, predicting work completion milestones for comparison with scheduled milestones, and showing the current status of work during the overhaul process. This problem space and project effort required a specific modeling and simulation approach that differs from most typical discrete event simulation models, primarily because the duration of individual work activities is determined based on the scope of the work, not an assigned length of time. This paper will summarize the problem space, the approach, the resulting tool, and its use cases.
