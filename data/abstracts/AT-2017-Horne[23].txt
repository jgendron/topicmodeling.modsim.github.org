Data Farming is a methodology that combines simulation modeling, rapid scenario generation, high performance computing, experimental design, analysis and visualization, and collaborative processes. Data farming is a quantified approach that examines questions in large possibility spaces and evaluates whole landscapes of outcomes to draw insights from outcome distributions and outliers. Data farming has been developed and utilized in many contexts to include a community of interest that has met to implement the methodology in workshops throughout the world. The group recently met for a week in Finland at the 31st workshop on data farming. At this workshop, model development continued through full immersion into the data farming process and many iterations of the data farming process were performed to gain insight into various Òwhat-if?Ó questions. A Black Swan event has three characteristics according to author Nassim Nicholas Taleb. First of all, the event is an outlier, i.e. it comes as a surprise. Secondly, the event has a major impact. And finally, the event can be explained after it occurs as if it could have been expected. Because data farming provides the capability of executing enough experiments so that outliers might be captured and examined for insights, it is particularly well suited for analysis of black-swan-type events. This paper describes data farming and a current application. Then it illustrates both successful and potential applications of data farming in the context of questions inherent in military decision-making involving some black-swan-type events.
