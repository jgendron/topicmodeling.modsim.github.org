The maintenance and overhaul worked performed on US Navy air craft carriers may be the most challenging industrial and engineering task undertaken anywhere by any organization (RAND National Defense Research Institute Study, 2002). During this complex process, sets of specialized tanks can cause unforeseen ripple effects on the entire overhaul process. In this paper, we introduce the utilization of M&S to create a tool for adaptive planning of specialized tank inspection and overhaul. This tool utilizes discrete event simulation, implemented in NNSs own simulation engine, to replicate the complex job processes involved in this work. This tool allows NNS to support work by providing an adaptive planning capability, accepting data about performance to date and providing likely scenario outcomes. Additionally, the tool supports pre-planning for future carrier work in these specialized tanks, taking previous performance measures and using them as a baseline to assess proposed new work methods.
