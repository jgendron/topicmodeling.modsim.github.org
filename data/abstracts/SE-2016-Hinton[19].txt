Food allergies are a growing public concern where strict avoidance of the offending allergen prevents life threatening allergic reactions. Recently, results from epicutaneous allergen specific immunotherapy (EPIT) clinical trials have been promising, where this method of treatment may become an attractive treatment option for food allergy sufferers in the future. While this evidenced based therapy is encouraging, many of the underlying mechanisms of allergen specific desensitization remain unknown. Langerhans Cells (LC), a specialized dendritic cell, are potent antigen presenting cells that reside mainly in the epidermis where they scan the microenvironment for pathogens and foreign material. Recent studies have shown LC are important mediators of immunotolerance, where they exert selective control over tolerance and immunity. In order to uncover some of the complex cellular interactions between immune cells during EPIT, a novel agent based model was developed and analyzed to describe how transdermal administration of peanut allergens stimulate the migration of Langerhans cells from the epidermis to the regional lymph nodes. The epidermal and dermal layers of the skin along with lymphatic vessels were modeled in Netlogo3D. Fine-tuned agent based models focused on EPIT may elucidate enigmatic mechanisms governing EPIT which could be useful in customizing treatment plans based on patient specific parameters and optimizing therapeutic outcomes.
