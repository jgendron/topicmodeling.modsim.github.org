The Joint Staff (JS) J7 Environment Architecture Division (EAD) is developing modular simulation services known as the Joint Training Tools (JTT) to reside within the Joint Training Synthetic Environment (JTSE). The JTSE will be a cloud based, web-enabled, enterprise environment that will provide scalable, on-demand modular simulations services designed to provide operationally relevant training for globally integrated operations. Order of Battle (OOB) and force management are critical components of military planning. Most military simulations incorporate OOB, but do not include aspect of force management. JTSE JTT Joint Training Data Services (JTDS) has enhanced OOB data with Force Management Service (FMS) data that includes detailed Global Force Management Implementation Guidance (GFMIG) information. GFMIG informational enables force assignments reflecting real-world constraints and incorporates aspects of force management with respect to capabilities, ready to load information, assignment, apportionment, and allocation. FMS allows users to create exercise-specific apportionment of units. When a trainee requests a force for a task, the force is requested based upon capability as signified by the GFMIG categories or types. Specified troops are apportioned and ready to load information and other attributes are reviewed prior to allocation. This gives the trainee insight into the reality of planning a campaign or maneuver with realistic force constraints. This paper will describe FMS attributes and how they can be used to influence battlefield situations and training.
