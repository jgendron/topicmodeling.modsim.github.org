   In this paper we present methods, process and algorithms to decipher the hidden rules or logic of complex traffic patterns â traces of assets, people and equipment -- and demonstrate technologies for Automated Rule Learning from Data Traces. We call this system for automated rule learning from data traces - TraceLogic. We demonstrate this technology on aircraft carriers. Operations on aircraft carriers are often described as controlled chaos. Complex organizational systems, such as those that govern and effect aircraft movement onboard carriers, do not operate on predetermined low level rules but rather adapt and learn based on high-level guidelines. Critical situations that are often new or unique are best tackled by adaptive and well-trained organizations. We present typical examples of data statistics, visual analytics, and rule and pattern analysis from carrier deck notional data. These techniques help analysts explore the data and improve the operational process. These tools could also support Validation and Verification (V&V) of the rules engine of the simulator. The algorithms and logic developed in TraceLogic are scalable across domains. The TraceLogic methodology, algorithms and tools have a number of potential customers in the Navy community, the broader Department of Defense community and the commercial sector. This technology will scale to manage any asset moving in groups subject to complex spatio-temporal constraints. Some of the possible application domains are depot maintenance, manufacturing shop floor, airport traffic management and even theme parks where people move in groups.
