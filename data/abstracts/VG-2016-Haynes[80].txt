Visualizing Big Data: Telling a Better Story
When you tell a story, people lean in; when you start talking about data, their eyes glaze over. We have seen in recent years a growing trend in the power of data to transform our businesses and our lives, but only if we understand and benefit from the insights that data provides. Stories allow us to put high-dimensional and high- velocity data into context by drawing on common ideas or experiences to highlight the impact on human experience. This paper provides insights on how visualization and storytelling relate to big data, the elements of successful data presentation, and expectations in the coming years. Often, the data available to us from enterprise systems is incomprehensible in raw form either because of its sheer volume or the rate at which it changes. Spreadsheets no longer serve the business community with a window into the heart of the data. Yes, there are data summaries that continue to provide value in spreadsheet applications, but tens or hundreds of thousands of rows of data in a spreadsheet are overwhelming to most decision makers. Meanwhile, the business intelligence platforms of the past must keep up with the dynamic nature of data streaming from Twitter, Facebook, and crowdsourcing. The study of data science encourages storytelling, but where are the artists? A visual representation of data that draws from the storytelling tradition can do for graphs what a good story does for a lecture.
