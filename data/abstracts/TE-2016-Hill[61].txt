Creating an experimental prototype simulation involves many project management, design, and development considerations. By highlighting the case of the Client Assessment Practice Simulation (CAPS) and its development from concept to working prototype, the authors hope to provide insight for similar teams undertaking similar projects. CAPS is a simulation for social work students to practice client interviewing skills in a medical setting and also be evaluated on those skills in a recorded and standardized way. Creating it required individuals of multiple disciplines from different university departments to communicate and make decisions. Through literature and existing product review as well as agile communication techniques that involve rapid and paper prototyping, the goals for CAPS came into clarity for all of the stakeholders early on. Frequent and regular communication allowed the stakeholders to stay engaged as the project evolved. The production approach by E2i Creative Studio at the University of Central Floridaâs Institute for Simulation and Training was also agile in nature. This paper provides an overview of the tools and techniques used to approach CAPSâ development so teams with similar goals involving mixed and unique disciplines can gain insight on starting and completing a multidisciplinary simulation project of an experimental nature.
