This paper presents work sponsored by Phase I Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) funding from the Office of Naval Research to develop a system that combines valuable aspects of intelligent tutoring systems and human-to- human adaptive training to aid instructors in providing individualized training. Our system, the Virtual Observer Controller for Adaptive Training (VOCAT), is an adaptive, intelligent virtual observer controller that has been built and demonstrated to run end-to-end in a synthetic training event example. Human instructors recognize that observed student actions may be the result of many possible cognitive reasoning paths and are able to provide student-specific guidance accordingly. VOCAT aims to aid instructors and enhance human-led adaptive training by reflecting on student-specific cognitive process models in order to: 1) identify how and when to provide student- specific guidance during training and 2) identify students' cognitive reasoning behind key decision points for use in an after action review.
