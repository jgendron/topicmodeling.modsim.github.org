Medical mannequins are used for a wide range of training purposes, including anesthesia, nursing care, and emergency care. Military medical training includes a significant component focusing on tactical combat casualty care (TC3). The TC3 curriculum targets combat medics and combat life savers, with a goal of training personnel in point of injury (POI) care. Many technologies augment TC3 training, including virtual simulations, part-task trainers, and medical mannequins. Unfortunately, most commercially available mannequins were developed to train nurses and doctors and have capabilities unused by the TC3 training community. As a result, the cost is higher than necessary. A recent research effort sought to develop a low-cost POI trainer with capabilities targeted specifically for the TC3 community. Within this paper, the research and design process of three prototype POI simulator is reported. Additionally, results of early usability testing conducted at the Fort Bragg Medical Simulation Training Center are detailed.
