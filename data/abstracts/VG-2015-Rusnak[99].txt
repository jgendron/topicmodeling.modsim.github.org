The purpose of this paper is to present a virtual integrated training environment (VITE) under development by ODU and EVMS for use with manikin-based medical training, in manner that exploits computer communication to the manikin. Current medical training uses a self-contained commercial manikin in an ordinary classroom lacking other medical equipment. This system includes tablet-based simulators that represent real medical equipment that is able to directly interact with the manikin. A previous capstone design class also developed a virtual environment with manikin-based training [2]. That group was able to develop virtual devices but was not able to get the devices to communicate with the manikin and vice versa. VITE will establish a communication network that integrates the functionality of the manikin with its surrounding environment. The manikin will function with devices that are able to send and receive information. The paper begins with a physical description of the overall system. Then, the system architecture and system components are detailed. The paper concludes with a functionality description of the prototype devices. A prototype system is currently being developed for Eastern Virginia Medical School as part of a M&SE Capstone Design Course at Old Dominion University.
