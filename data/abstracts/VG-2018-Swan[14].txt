The advantages and limitations of different terrain generation techniques that are often used to meet
specific simulation requirements.
visualization system.
How source GIS data is loaded, stored and served up; how the earthâs surface and man-made objects are
modeled; and how high resolution detail can be procedurally added to the scene on the fly.
How different terrain techniques can be mixed to support different use cases and how correlation can be
achieved across disparate simulations, even with dynamic terrains.
  New techniques and technology that can achieve the desired goal of a ubiquitous, multi-purpose
 Iâll conclude by providing specific examples and applications that have been delivered using this new technology.
