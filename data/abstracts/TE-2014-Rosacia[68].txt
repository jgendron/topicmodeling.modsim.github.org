A Source Selection Advisory Team (SSAT) consisting of subject matter experts in program management, contracts, and engineering functional areas has been established by the Program Executive Office Simulation Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI) Head Contracting Authority to simplify and implement uniform and consistent procedures for source selection acquisitions. Additional objectives include providing standardized educational training to the workforce to include pre-solicitation and source selection evaluation training for all Source Selection TeamsÕ (SSTs) best value acquisitions. The SSAT concept is to centralize the development of improved source selection process artifacts, tools, instructions, communications with industry, and best practices and promote that knowledge and capabilities to the entire workforce. The SSAT is integrating common source selection principles early in the solicitation development process to influence the quality of future procurements by ensuring best practices are applied consistently to deliver both technical and cost best value training solutions. This paper provides an overview of the SSAT workforce education training concept, roles and responsibilities, process methodologies, and standards established. The paper will focus on the SSAT delivery of the workforce education training concept, describe how SSAT interfaces with the workforce and industry, and describe how to develop improvements within the source selection process from program initiation to award phase for all Army simulation, training, and instrumentation community best value source selections. This paper will also provide lessons learned, challenges encountered, metrics, best practices and way ahead for continuous improvement of the source selection process for Army simulation and training environment.
