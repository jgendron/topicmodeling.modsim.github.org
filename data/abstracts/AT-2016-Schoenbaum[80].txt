Simulation modeling is a well-established and essential tool for epidemiologic investigations, including population disease dynamics and the evaluation of mechanisms for disease control. Agricultural economic models allow users to go beyond disease impacts to explore the cost implications of animal disease.

In addition to describing some of these modeling tools, this presentation also covers some lessons learned while supporting the 2015 avian influenza outbreak.
