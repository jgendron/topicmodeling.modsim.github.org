Much has been said in recent years about the need to involve and integrate more tools of technology into the learning process for todayÕs digital learner. However, the majority of the focus has been on ease of use, whether making delivery of instruction different, or replicating hard copies of learning materials into digital ones. In the emerging era, the focus no longer needs to be solely on the ease of use.
The shifted target should be on the adapted learner. No longer will the learner be on an island in a learning ecosystem that makes them feel uncomfortable. Instead the case should be made for creating, in the learner, a stakeholder in their pathway to success. This is done by exploring how to incorporate innovations in learning technology into the instructional design to allow an adaptive environment for the learner to excel in, by gaining deliberate practice in areas where they need it most, as well as increasing repetitions and sets towards achieving mastery in their area.
This paper will demonstrate the case to shift emphasis to the benefits in learning efficiencies, increased adaptability, and personalization that innovations in learning technology can provide to the learner. Also, by identifying the gaps that still persist inside an organization that continues to move forward with modernization, but are subsequently leaving the learner behind, will illustrate the requirement for proper implementation with a learning outcome in mind, versus creating the false appearance of progress by providing a shiny new object.
