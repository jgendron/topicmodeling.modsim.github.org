The Programs of Instruction (POIs) at the U.S. Army Medical Simulation Training Centers (MSTCs) rely on rugged and reliable training aides to include Part Task Trainers (PTTs) to provide effective emergency medicine training of lifesaving procedures and critical skills. In order to create an immersive training experience, training models must be anatomically correct and provide accurate physiological responses. However, in regards to venipuncture and phlebotomy training models, available technologies are often inadequate due to a lack of anatomical and physiological accuracy. A recent evaluation of currently available technology concluded that there has been little innovation or improvement in vascular access training models; many follow the same design and utilize similar materials. Most PTTs simulate vasculature utilizing a single latex tube, the majority of the simulated skins are opaque in color, and they have limited elasticity. These shortcomings prevent the learner from developing the skill of using his or her visual senses to observe the vessels below a translucent skin surface, as can be done on human patients. The limited elasticity of the materials is a challenge when trying to replace or remove the skin from the inner IV arm cores. This paper will discuss the work completed to develop a high fidelity prototype venipuncture and phlebotomy PTT while focusing on advancing the material science to provide more realistic tissue. An update will be provided to the usability study that includes additional participants across the continuum of care.
