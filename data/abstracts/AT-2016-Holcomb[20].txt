The Mahalanobis Taguchi System (MTS) uses multivariate data in a unique way, to enable recognition, diagnosis, and prediction of important conditions for a wide variety of applications in various industries. The modeling and simulation discipline could benefit from adding MTS pattern recognition to their tool set for analysis of simulation results and decision support. MTS is based on the combined works of Dr. P.C. Mahalanobis, Dr. Genichi Taguchi, Dr. Rajesh Jugulum, Dr. Soichi Teshima, and others. Although the MTS approach is not well known in the U.S., it has provided benefits worth considering in many diverse applications over the past couple of decades, including manufacturing, healthcare, and vehicle control systems. It has proven to be superior in several ways to other recognition and prediction approaches, such as regression analysis and neural networks. Unlike more complex methods like artificial neural networks, MTS can be successfully demonstrated and experienced by analysts, programmers, and engineers with simple analysis tools like Excel. This technique may be useful to modeling and simulation researchers, and professionals interested in a straightforward recognition and prediction approach, which resolves multi-dimensional problems into a simple, single measurement scale.
The paper will introduce 1) A concise explanation of the concepts behind the MTS and its various uses, 2) An introduction to the computational methods for MTS, including a simple live demonstration, 3) Optimization of the MTS approach to ensure reliable predictions with the fewest possible parameters, 4) Summary of several MTS case studies from various industries, and 5) Comparison of advantages and disadvantages between MTS and other recognition and prediction methods.
