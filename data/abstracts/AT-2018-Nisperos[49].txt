Food security and sustainable agriculture are two of the challenges faced by nations globally. As a population grows, the demand for food rises. To keep up with the demand without compromising the environment, sustainable agriculture techniques are significantly being studied and advocated by concerned organizations like the United Nations (UN). The UN furthers sustainable agriculture through its Sustainable Development Goal 2 (SDG 2) which aspires to double the agricultural productivity and incomes of small-scale food producers and ensure sustainable food production systems and implement resilient agricultural practices.
Smallholder farming households, which has an estimated global population of 500 million (around 2 billion people), rely on small-scale agriculture for their livelihoods. They are considered as the backbone of agricultural production in developing countries and they play a key role in upholding sustainability. Having a crop rotation sustainability assessment tool for smallholder farmers can aid them accordingly in their crop production planning and abet the advocacy of agriculture sustainability.
Our research aims to develop a model-driven decision support tool for smallholder farmers to promote sustainability in their crop production practices. In this paper, we investigate the integration of crop simulation model and multi- criteria decision analysis as an approach for a dynamic and multi-criteria sustainability assessment of crop rotation alternatives.
