Army trainer maintenance tends to be based on a preventative maintenance schedule supplied by the trainer manufacturer and planned based on achieving standards of operational availability. These schedules do not take into account actual delivered usage. The Army can reduce costs by tying the maintenance of training systems to the use of the systems. Although there are many ways in which usage can be tracked, some combinations of metrics are more closely correlated to the need for corrective action maintenance. Selection of the most appropriate measure or set of measures often depends on the design of the training device. Generally this selection can best be determined based onhistoricaldata.

In order to reduce maintenance costs while improving training delivery, actual use of the training device needs to be collected.
