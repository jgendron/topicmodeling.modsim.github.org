We demonstrate a model-based systems engineering (MBSE) approach to analyzing how information resources and the policies that govern their use impact security workflows. This approach establishes a crucial connection between workflow and the information sharing environment and enables the formative evaluation of candidate interventions designed to enhance security, such as new information systems and data standards. We (1) modeled the use and generation of security information in support of marine terminal operations and (2) analyzed security as a service in support of those operations. Our approach uses extensions of the Object Management GroupÕs (OMG) Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) standard and integrates workflow modeling with an information dictionary that records and automatically generates task-specific information requirements. The scope of the model we present is containerized cargo operations at a commercial marine terminal. The approach, which connects work activity to information flow, can be applied to analyze trade-offs between better information resources and more physical resources and to identify where and how future systems and programs will impact current operations. We discuss how the MBSE technique of generating the information dictionary aligns with important federal efforts to capture essential information exchange requirements.
